# Bubble-Sort-Prioritizing-For-Requirements
A Python-program for prioritizing requirements using the Bubble Sort Technique

## Requirements
This program only requires the Pandas package, which can be installed through pip:

`pip install pandas`

## How to use
To use this program, define your requirements in a csv-file called `requirements.csv`. The file should consist of two columns: `index` and `requirement`. See the example in `requirements.csv`. Store the file in the same folder as `main.py`. 

You can also edit the exisiting `requirements.csv` file to add your requirements. After the requirements are added to the file, run `main.py`. After going through the program, your sorted requirements will be saved to `sorted_requirements.csv`.
